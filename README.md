# TOUR: Tales Of Unexplored Realms

**Introduction**:
TOUR offers a collaborative novel-writing experience where users and AI embark on creative storytelling journeys together. The app enables users to unfold their story, followed by AI generating subsequent sections. This iterative process allows users to collectively create a novel, alternating between human creativity and AI contribution.
